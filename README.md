# markdown_reports_for_web
this is a test repo for writing some reports in markdown format for using in github page

when you write LaTex in Markdown, it will be rendered as a formula using MathJax. Like:
```
\\( P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A),P(A)}{P(B)}   \\)
```

\\( P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A),P(A)}{P(B)}   \\)


or you can insert code block in different programming languages:

for python:

```python
import numpy as np
```
-----
for fortran:

```fortran
implicit none
integer:: i,j
real:r
```
